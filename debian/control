Description: Python Build Reasonableness - Python 2.x
 PBR is a library that injects some useful and sensible default behaviors into
 your setuptools run. It started off life as the chunks of code that were
 copied between all of the OpenStack projects. Around the time that OpenStack
 hit 18 different projects each with at least 3 active branches, it seems like
 a good time to make that code into a proper re-usable library.
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of `d2to1` to provide for declarative configuration. It then
 filters the `setup.cfg` data through a setup hook to fill in default values
 and provide more sensible behaviors.
 .
 This package provides support for Python 2.x.
